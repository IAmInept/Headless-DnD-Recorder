# Summary
A project designed to solve and implement automation of recording Video & Audio with an intuitive Web-UI, joining Foundry Sessions via browser Automation using Playwright capturing video, and then automating the process of joining a discord server, joining a voice channel, and recording the audio in sync and combining the two
to upload to a File Hosting Service (Nextcloud).

## What does this project hope to solve?
Often during Virtual (Online) DnD Sessions, recordings can corrupt, players (or DMs) struggle to setup a method to record their sessions without it intrusively interrupting their sessions flow or simply forget, this project aims to provide a solution to this problem, by running entirely in a headless environment, where no UI is needed and can be controlled directly by a UI Interface embedded within a browser.

## This projects goals are to
- Initalise a Virtual Framebuffer (Xvbf). 
- capture the framebuffer using ffmpeg.
- Intalize a browser and automate login 
- Deploy a Webserver to automate starting and stopping of script
- Join Discord Server (Via Web-UI)
- Initalise Recording Audio
- Combine the Video & Audio files and upload via Nextcloud (Self Hosted)

## Contributions
While not necessary, they are welcome, I am not a software developer by trade, and my code is by no means optiomal or efficient (as of early conception into project) any help or advice on the project is widely accepted and welcomed.

This project was made with passion and the secondary motive to be a portfolio piece, feel free to fork, re-write or contribute as you please.
